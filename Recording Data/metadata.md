This folder contains the neuronal spiking activity data that are used in this study. Recording experiments are labeled accordingly in *"spiketimes_data"*. Each array indicates spike times of a neuron obtained from extracellular recordings with a duration of 100 sec after spike sorting (see SI methods).

***Conrtol*** data are used in determining sources of heterogeneous firing activities in sensory pyramidal neurons.

***Block*** data are obtained from pyramidal neurons with label ids indicated in "block_cell_ids" file, after pharmacological inactivation of feedback

***Serotonin*** data are obtained from pyramidal neurons with label ids indicated in "serotonin_cell_ids" file, after exogenous serotonin application.
